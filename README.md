## A place where to feel free to confess anything anonymously

We were asked to create a website where users should be able to post journal entries anonymously. We all decided during our first meeting the website would be about anonymous confessions. Somewhere to be free to confess anything being able to share a gif if that helps you to express your confession better. Users can react with emojis to others confessions and also leave a comment.
