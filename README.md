BY [Arvin Jhurry](https://github.com/ArvinJhurry), [Anh Nguyen](https://github.com/hihaianh), [Harry Moore](https://github.com/umalik00), [Isabel Repetto](https://github.com/neifors)

## A place where to feel free to confess anything anonymously

We were asked to create a website where users should be able to post journal entries anonymously. We all decided during our first meeting the website would be about anonymous confessions. Somewhere to be free to confess anything being able to share a gif if that helps you to express your confession better. Users can react with emojis to others confessions and also leave a comment. 

## PROCESS
- Meeting to plan how to approach the work and how the distribution of task was going to be.

- Server:
	- Creating a Data Structure prototype to start working with. 

   ![data structure](./Documentation/data%20structure2.png "proposed data structure")
	- Using that prototype to create a model and all the methods we decided the object should have. 
	- Writting a data sample to work with. A JSON file where all our data will be saved.
	- Installing **Express.js** which is a modular web framework for Node.js used for easier creation of web applications and services.
	- Building endpoints and functionality. All the urls and behaviors the client needs to communicate with the server (GET, POST and DELETE methods).
	- Creating really simple clients to play around with the server and checking the post and delete methods mostly.
	- Testing by using **jest** and **supertest** *(A library for testing node.js HTTP servers)*
	- Deployed on [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/)
